  * Super (scriptable) socket
  * Asynchronous connect
  * Socket types:
    * Request <-> Reply
    * Push <-> Subscribe

* *pretty fast, can't keep up taking notes. He mainly shows ZeroMQ features*
* *Code dive with Ruby bindings on socket creation and more. Sorry, the pace left me stranded.*

#### Techniques

* No colorized source code
